1. Kotlin language
2. Fragments
3. View models

4. Buy a meal
5. Book to pass the line
6. See the last Notices
7. Manage the cafeteria's wallet

# How it works
1. The Retrofit calls to link with the server 
2. Room to manage the persistence data stored in the device
3. Viewmodels to manage all the data showed in the app
4. MySQL to query the DBMS  to take stored data and to put new data
